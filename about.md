大嘴,出生于1984-11-21，已婚，目前定居上海  
But: 大嘴并不是我管不住嘴，而是天生嗓门比较大  
一身都是病：VIM重症患者，最近开始写论文，迷恋上emacs了，CUI重症患者，键盘重症患者,网络重症患者......  
代码洁癖重症患者，看见或者想到可以重构的代码会往往管不住自己的手指  
音乐重症患者，上班带耳机，写代码带耳机......,走路不带（PS：杀手太多，不敢带）  
阅读中度患者，家里2个书架基本上都被我霸占了  
机械爱好者，不喜欢电子产品。PS：奇怪，我怎么做码农这一行的？  
宅男，只要不是LP拖着，哪里都不想去  
弱智，IQ缺乏重症患者，看见智商测试就头疼，并且从未超过36分  
懒，超级懒。懒到桌子经常被成为"垃圾堆"，懒到我妈觉得没人嫁给我（PS:显然她失算了)
